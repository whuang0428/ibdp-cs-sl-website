## 5. Exam Technique for A1 and A2

### For Hardware Questions

Use precise roles.

Weak:

```text
The CPU is the brain.
```

Strong:

```text
The CPU executes instructions by fetching, decoding, and executing them, using components such as the control unit, ALU, and registers.
```

---

### For Networking Questions

Always include:

```text
device/protocol/control
how it works
why it matters in the scenario
```

Example:

```text
A firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic using security rules, reducing unauthorized access to the school network.
```

---

### For Security Questions

Use this structure:

```text
Threat → Protection → How it works → Scenario impact
```

Example:

```text
Encryption protects data during transmission by converting it into unreadable ciphertext. This means that if patient records are intercepted, the attacker cannot understand them without the key.
```

## 7. Practice Set 2: Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

### Question 1 [3 marks]

Describe the fetch stage of the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

During the fetch stage, the CPU uses the program counter to identify the address of the next instruction. The address is copied to the memory address register, and the instruction is fetched from memory into the memory data register/current instruction register. The program counter is then updated to point to the next instruction.

</details>

---

### Question 2 [3 marks]

Describe the decode stage.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

During the decode stage, the control unit interprets the fetched instruction to determine what operation is required and which data or registers are involved.

</details>

---

### Question 3 [3 marks]

An operating system manages memory by allocating memory to running programs and freeing it when no longer needed. It also manages files by storing, organizing, retrieving, and controlling access to files. Other valid functions include process management, device management, user interface, security, and resource accounting.

### Question 6 [6 marks]

Compare compiled and interpreted code.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

Compiled code is translated into machine code before execution, often producing an executable file. Interpreted code is translated and executed line by line at runtime. Compiled programs may execute faster after compilation, while interpreted programs may be easier to test and debug because errors can be found line by line.

### Question 7 [6 marks]

Discuss one advantage and one disadvantage of cloud storage.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

One advantage of cloud storage is accessibility because users can access files from different devices and locations using the internet. It may also support backup and recovery if a local device fails. One disadvantage is that it depends on internet access, so users may not access files if the connection is unavailable. It can also raise privacy and security concerns because data is stored by a third-party provider.

### Question 1 [2 marks]

Define LAN.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

A LAN is a network that connects devices over a small geographical area, such as a home, school, or office.

</details>

---

### Question 2 [3 marks]

State three network devices.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

Possible answers:

```text
router
switch
server
wireless access point
modem
firewall
```

</details>

---

### Question 3 [4 marks]

Describe the role of DNS.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

DNS translates a human-readable domain name into an IP address. This allows a browser or client device to send a request to the correct web server.

</details>

---

### Question 4 [5 marks]

Describe packet switching.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

Packet switching splits data into smaller packets before transmission. Each packet includes addressing information and may travel independently across the network. Packets may take different routes and are reassembled at the destination.

</details>

---

### Question 5 [4 marks]

Explain how encryption protects data sent across a network.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

Encryption converts data into unreadable ciphertext using a key. If the data is intercepted during transmission, an attacker cannot understand it without the correct decryption key.

</details>

---

### Question 6 [6 marks]

Compare client-server and peer-to-peer networks.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

A client-server network uses central servers to provide services or resources to client devices. A peer-to-peer network allows devices to share resources directly without a central server. Client-server networks can be easier to manage and secure centrally, while peer-to-peer networks can be cheaper and simpler for small networks but harder to control as they grow.

</details>

---

### Question 7 [6 marks]

Explain two methods that can reduce unauthorized access to a network.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

A firewall can filter traffic using security rules, blocking unauthorized or suspicious connections. Multi-factor authentication can require users to provide more than one form of verification, reducing the risk that a stolen password alone gives access. Other valid methods include strong passwords, access control, encryption, VPNs, network segmentation, and regular monitoring.

## 25. Common A1 and A2 Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Loses Marks | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| CPU called only "brain" | too vague | describe execution/control role |
| accumulator confused with program counter | wrong register role | accumulator stores intermediate ALU results |
| RAM and storage confused | volatility misunderstood | RAM volatile; storage non-volatile |
| cache described as secondary storage | wrong category | cache is small fast memory near CPU |
| hex conversion without 4-bit groups | wrong binary output | use nibbles |
| truth table misses rows | incomplete answer | use all input combinations |
| OS described only as "screen" | too narrow | mention resource management |
| router and switch confused | wrong device role | router between networks; switch within LAN |
| IP and MAC confused | addressing unclear | IP logical network address; MAC hardware/local address |
| firewall and encryption confused | different controls | firewall filters traffic; encryption hides content |
| VPN described as only "private internet" | vague | encrypted tunnel across network |
| DNS described as search engine | wrong | translates domain to IP address |
| packet switching described without packets | missing core idea | split, route, reassemble |
