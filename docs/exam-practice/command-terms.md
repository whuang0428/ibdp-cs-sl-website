# Command Terms

## 1. Page Purpose

Command terms tell students **what type of answer** the question wants.

A student may know the topic, but still lose marks if they answer the command term wrongly.

Example:

```text
State one advantage of encryption. [1]
```

This needs a short answer.

```text
Encryption protects data from being read by unauthorized users.
```

But:

```text
Explain one advantage of encryption. [2]
```

needs more detail.

```text
Encryption converts data into an unreadable form so that if it is intercepted, the attacker cannot understand it without the decryption key.
```

The same topic can require different answer depth depending on the command term.

---

## 2. Learning Goals

By the end of this page, students should be able to:

- identify common command terms in Computer Science exam questions
- explain what each command term requires
- match answer depth to the mark value
- distinguish `state`, `outline`, `describe`, and `explain`
- distinguish `compare`, `discuss`, and `evaluate`
- write short answers for low-mark questions
- write developed answers for explain/describe questions
- write balanced answers for discuss/evaluate questions
- apply command terms to CS topics such as networks, databases, ML, algorithms, and security
- avoid common mistakes caused by misunderstanding command terms

## 4. Bilingual Explanation

<LangBlock>
<template #cn>

### 中文说明

Command term 就是题目开头的动词，比如：

```text
state
identify
outline
describe
explain
discuss
evaluate
```

它决定你要写多少，以及答案要不要解释原因。

很多学生失分不是因为知识点不会，而是因为：

```text
题目只问 state，但写太多浪费时间
题目问 explain，但只写一个词
题目问 discuss，但只写一边好处
题目问 evaluate，但没有 judgement / conclusion
```

最重要的区别：

```text
state = 直接给答案
outline = 简短说明
describe = 描述特点/过程
explain = 说明原因/机制/影响
discuss = 多角度讨论
evaluate = 分析优缺点并给判断
```

考试中可以记住一个公式：

```text
Point → Expansion → Scenario Link
```

比如：

```text
VPN improves security.
It creates an encrypted tunnel between the user device and the organization network.
This helps remote hospital staff access patient systems more safely.
```

</template>

<template #en>

### English Explanation

A command term is the verb at the start of the question, such as:

```text
state
identify
outline
describe
explain
discuss
evaluate
```

It decides how much you should write and whether you need to explain reasons.

Many students lose marks not because they do not know the topic, but because they:

```text
write too much for state questions
write only one word for explain questions
write only one side for discuss questions
give no judgement for evaluate questions
```

The most important difference:

```text
state = give the answer directly
outline = brief point with small detail
describe = give features/process/details
explain = give reason/mechanism/effect
discuss = consider different sides
evaluate = analyse strengths/weaknesses and give judgement
```

A useful exam formula is:

```text
Point → Expansion → Scenario Link
```

Example:

```text
A VPN improves security.
It creates an encrypted tunnel between the user device and the organization network.
This helps remote hospital staff access patient systems more safely.
```

</template>

## 5. State

`State` means give a short direct answer.

### What to Do

```text
give one fact
do not explain unless needed
keep it short
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
State one type of primary memory. [1]
```

Answer:

```text
RAM
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
State one network device used to connect a LAN to the internet. [1]
```

Answer:

```text
Router
```

### Common Mistake

Writing a long paragraph wastes time.

---

## 6. Identify

`Identify` means name or select the correct item.

### What to Do

```text
look at the scenario/data/diagram
name the correct part
give a short answer
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
Identify the field that could be used as the primary key. [1]
```

Answer:

```text
StudentID
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
Identify the type of learning used when labelled data is used to train a model. [1]
```

Answer:

```text
Supervised learning
```

### Difference from State

They are similar, but `identify` often asks you to choose from a given context.

---

## 7. List

`List` means give several items.

### What to Do

```text
write separate items
do not explain unless marks require it
match the number requested
```

### Example

Question:

```text
List three examples of network security measures. [3]
```

Answer:

```text
firewall
encryption
multi-factor authentication
```

### Common Mistake

Giving one item with three sentences does not answer `list three`.

---

## 8. Define

`Define` means give the exact meaning of a term.

### What to Do

```text
write a precise meaning
include key technical words
avoid examples only
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
Define primary key. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
Define machine learning. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
Machine learning is a technique where a system learns patterns from data and uses a trained model to make predictions or decisions on new data.
```

### Common Mistake

Only giving an example.

Weak:

```text
StudentID is a primary key.
```

This is an example, not a definition.

---

## 9. Outline

`Outline` means give a brief point with some detail.

### What to Do

```text
give the main point
add a short explanation
do not write too much
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Outline one advantage of using cloud storage. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
Cloud storage improves accessibility because users can access files from different devices and locations through the internet.
```

### Structure

```text
Point + small expansion
```

### Difference from State

`State` may only need:

```text
accessibility
```

`Outline` needs a little detail:

```text
accessibility because files can be accessed from different devices and locations
```

---

## 10. Describe

`Describe` means give features, details, or steps.

### What to Do

```text
say what something is like
give relevant details
describe process if asked
do not only name it
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
Describe the function of a router. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
A router forwards data packets between different networks. It uses IP addresses to decide where packets should be sent next.
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
Describe how data is retrieved when a user enters a URL in a web browser. [4]
```

Answer:

```text
The browser sends a request to find the IP address for the domain name using DNS. It then sends a request to the web server at that IP address. The server sends the requested web page data back to the browser, which renders the page for the user.
```

### Difference from Explain

`Describe` can focus on what happens.  
`Explain` usually needs why/how this causes an effect.

---

## 11. Explain

`Explain` means give a reason, cause, effect, or how something works.

### What to Do

Use:

```text
Point → because/how → effect
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
Explain why encryption is used when sending patient records. [3]
```

Answer:

```text
Encryption converts patient records into an unreadable form during transmission. This means that if the data is intercepted, an attacker cannot understand it without the decryption key. This protects sensitive medical information from unauthorized access.
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
Explain why accuracy may be misleading in fraud detection. [3]
```

Answer:

```text
Fraud datasets are often imbalanced because most transactions are not fraud. A model could predict not fraud for almost every transaction and still get high accuracy. However, it may miss the actual fraud cases, so accuracy alone does not show whether the model is useful.
```

### Common Mistake

Only stating the point.

Weak:

```text
Encryption is secure.
```

Better:

```text
Encryption protects data by making it unreadable without the key.
```

---

## 12. Distinguish

`Distinguish` means show the difference clearly.

### What to Do

```text
define both terms
show the contrast
use "whereas" or "while"
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
Distinguish between RAM and secondary storage. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
RAM is volatile primary memory used to store data and instructions currently in use, whereas secondary storage is non-volatile storage used to keep data long term.
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
Distinguish between classification and regression. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
Classification predicts a category or class, while regression predicts a numerical value.
```

### Good Sentence Pattern

```text
A is..., whereas B is...
```

---

## 13. Compare

`Compare` means give similarities and/or differences.

### What to Do

```text
mention both items
use clear comparison language
organize by points
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Compare LAN and WAN. [4]
```

Answer:

```text
A LAN covers a small geographical area such as a school or office, while a WAN covers a larger area such as multiple cities or countries. A LAN is usually owned and managed by one organization, whereas a WAN may use infrastructure from telecommunications providers. Both allow devices to communicate and share resources.
```

### Structure

```text
Similarity
Difference 1
Difference 2
```

### Common Mistake

Only describing one side.

---

## 14. Discuss

`Discuss` means present different sides or viewpoints.

### What to Do

```text
give advantages
give disadvantages or limitations
link to scenario
do not write one-sided answer
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Discuss the use of BYOD in a hospital. [6]
```

Answer:

```text
BYOD can reduce hardware costs because the hospital does not need to provide every employee with a device. Employees may also be familiar with their own devices, which can reduce training time. However, BYOD creates security risks because personal devices may not be updated or may be lost. The hospital would need controls such as mobile device management, encryption, and access control to protect patient data.
```

### Good Phrases

```text
One advantage is...
However...
A limitation is...
In this scenario...
```

---

## 15. Evaluate

`Evaluate` means judge strengths and weaknesses and reach a reasoned conclusion.

### What to Do

```text
give benefits
give limitations
consider scenario impact
make a judgement
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Evaluate whether a hospital should use cloud storage for patient records. [8]
```

Answer:

```text
Cloud storage could improve accessibility because authorized staff may access patient records from different hospital locations or during remote work. It may also improve resilience if the provider offers backup and disaster recovery. However, patient records are sensitive, so the hospital must consider privacy, access control, encryption, and legal compliance. Cloud storage also depends on internet connectivity and trust in the provider. Overall, cloud storage could be suitable if strong security, clear access policies, and reliable backup arrangements are in place, but it should not be adopted without careful risk assessment.
```

### Difference from Discuss

`Discuss` gives balanced points.  
`Evaluate` also makes a judgement.

---

## 16. Suggest

`Suggest` means propose a suitable answer, often based on the scenario.

### What to Do

```text
give a reasonable idea
make it fit the scenario
explain briefly if marks require
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Suggest one security measure for employees accessing hospital systems remotely. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
Multi-factor authentication could be used so employees need a password and a second verification method, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if a password is stolen.
```

### Common Mistake

Suggesting something unrelated to the scenario.

---

## 17. Justify

`Justify` means support a choice with reasons.

### What to Do

```text
state the choice
give reasons
link to scenario
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Justify the use of a VPN for remote employees. [3]
```

Answer:

```text
A VPN is suitable because it creates an encrypted tunnel between the employee's device and the organization network. This protects data from interception when staff work remotely over public or home networks. It is especially important if employees access sensitive records.
```

### Difference from Explain

`Explain` describes why/how.  
`Justify` supports a decision or recommendation.

---

## 18. Construct

`Construct` means build or create the required answer.

### Common CS Examples

```text
construct a truth table
construct an SQL query
construct a flowchart
construct an algorithm
construct a database table design
```

### Example: SQL

Question:

```text
Construct an SQL query to list each patient name once where treatment includes the word therapy. [3]
```

Answer:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT PatientName
FROM VISITS
WHERE Treatment LIKE '%therapy%';
```

### Example: Truth Table

Question:

```text
Construct a truth table for X AND NOT Y. [4]
```

Answer:

| X | Y | NOT Y | X AND NOT Y |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

### Strategy

Make sure the structure is complete.

---

## 19. Trace

`Trace` means follow an algorithm step by step.

### What to Do

```text
track variable values
record outputs
follow loops carefully
use input values in order
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Trace the algorithm with inputs 4, 7, 2.
```

Algorithm:

```text
total ← 0
FOR i ← 1 TO 3
    INPUT n
    total ← total + n
ENDFOR
OUTPUT total
```

Answer:

| Iteration | i | n | total | Output |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Start |  |  | 0 |  |
| 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 |  |
| 2 | 2 | 7 | 11 |  |
| 3 | 3 | 2 | 13 |  |
| End |  |  | 13 | 13 |

### Common Mistake

Guessing the output without tracking variables.

---

## 20. Calculate

`Calculate` means work out a numerical answer.

### What to Do

```text
show key working if marks are more than 1
give final value clearly
include units if needed
```

### Example 1

Question:

```text
Calculate the denary value of binary 1011. [1]
```

Answer:

```text
11
```

### Example 2

Question:

```text
Calculate the average of 10, 20, and 30. [2]
```

Answer:

```text
(10 + 20 + 30) / 3 = 20
```

### Common Mistake

Only giving working but no final answer.

---

## 21. Sketch / Draw

`Sketch` or `draw` means produce a diagram.

### What to Do

```text
make diagram clear
label important parts
use correct symbols
do not worry about artistic quality
```

### Examples

```text
draw a flowchart
draw a network diagram
sketch a class diagram
draw a database relationship
```

### Exam Tip

Labels usually matter more than perfect shape.

---

## 22. Command Term Depth Ladder

A useful way to remember answer depth:

```text
state / identify / list
↓
define
↓
outline
↓
describe
↓
explain
↓
discuss
↓
evaluate
```

### Rough Meaning

```text
short answer
→ meaning
→ brief detail
→ more detail
→ reason/effect
→ balanced view
→ balanced judgement
```

---

## 23. State vs Outline vs Describe vs Explain

These four are often confused.

| Term | Expected Depth | Example Topic: Firewall |
|---|---|---|
| State | name one point | firewall |
| Outline | brief detail | A firewall filters network traffic. |
| Describe | give features | A firewall checks incoming and outgoing traffic against security rules. |
| Explain | give reason/effect | A firewall reduces unauthorized access because it blocks traffic that does not meet security rules. |

### Exam Tip

If the question says `explain`, use words like:

```text
because
so that
this means
therefore
as a result
```

---

## 24. Describe vs Explain

### Describe

Focuses on:

```text
what it is
what happens
what features it has
```

Example:

```text
A router forwards packets between networks using IP addresses.
```

### Explain

Focuses on:

```text
why it matters
how it works
what effect it has
```

Example:

```text
A router allows a LAN to access the internet because it forwards packets between the local network and external networks.
```

### Quick Memory

```text
describe = what
explain = why/how
```

---

## 25. Discuss vs Evaluate

### Discuss

A discuss answer should consider more than one side.

```text
advantages
disadvantages
different stakeholders
limitations
```

### Evaluate

An evaluate answer should also include judgement.

```text
how effective?
how suitable?
to what extent?
overall conclusion?
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Discuss BYOD.
```

Expected:

```text
benefits and risks
```

Question:

```text
Evaluate whether BYOD is suitable for a hospital.
```

Expected:

```text
benefits and risks + judgement about suitability
```

---

## 26. Mark Value and Command Term Together

Do not read the command term alone.  
Also check marks.

### Example

```text
Explain one advantage of a VPN. [2]
```

Likely:

```text
1 mark for advantage
1 mark for explanation
```

### Example

```text
Explain two advantages of a VPN. [4]
```

Likely:

```text
advantage 1 + explanation
advantage 2 + explanation
```

### Example

```text
Discuss the use of VPNs for remote work. [6]
```

Likely:

```text
multiple developed points, including benefits and limitations
```

---

## 27. Scenario Linking

When the question gives a scenario, command terms often require application.

### Generic Answer

```text
Encryption is secure.
```

### Scenario-linked Answer

```text
Encryption protects patient records by making them unreadable if intercepted during transmission between remote staff and the hospital network.
```

### Why Stronger?

It includes:

```text
technical method = encryption
scenario data = patient records
threat = intercepted during transmission
scenario user = remote staff
```

---

## 28. Worked Example: Networking

### Question

```text
Explain one reason a hospital may use a VPN for remote workers. [3]
```

### Weak Answer

```text
It is secure.
```

### Strong Answer

```text
A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the remote worker's device and the hospital network. This protects data from being read if it is intercepted over the internet. This is important because remote staff may access sensitive patient records.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
VPN mechanism
security effect
hospital scenario link
```

---

## 29. Worked Example: Databases

### Question

```text
Distinguish between a primary key and a foreign key. [2]
```

### Strong Answer

```text
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, whereas a foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table to create a relationship.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
primary key role
foreign key role
clear contrast
```

---

## 30. Worked Example: Machine Learning

### Question

```text
Explain why testing data should be separate from training data. [3]
```

### Strong Answer

```text
Testing data should be separate so the model is evaluated on data it has not seen during training. This gives a more reliable estimate of how well it will perform on new examples. If the same data is used for training and testing, the model may appear accurate because it memorized the training data.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
unseen data
generalization
risk of memorization/overfitting
```

---

## 31. Worked Example: Algorithms

### Question

```text
Trace the following algorithm with inputs 5 and 8. [4]
```

Algorithm:

```text
INPUT a
INPUT b
total ← a + b
OUTPUT total
```

### Strong Answer

| Step | a | b | total | Output |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 5 |  |  |  |
| 2 | 5 | 8 |  |  |
| 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 |  |
| 4 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 13 |

### Why It Scores

```text
inputs used in order
variable value tracked
output recorded correctly
```

---

## 32. Worked Example: Extended Evaluation

### Question

```text
Evaluate whether a school should use a machine learning system to predict students at risk of failing. [8]
```

### Strong Answer

```text
A machine learning system could help the school identify students who may need support earlier by analysing data such as attendance, previous grades, and assignment completion. This could allow teachers to provide extra help before the final exam.

However, the system could also make incorrect predictions. A false positive may unfairly label a student as at risk, while a false negative may miss a student who needs help. The model may also be biased if the training data does not represent all student groups fairly.

Privacy is another concern because the system may process sensitive student data. The school should use data minimization, access control, and human oversight. Teachers should review predictions and use them to support students rather than punish them.

Overall, the system could be useful as a decision-support tool, but it should not make automatic decisions about students without teacher review, fairness testing, and privacy protection.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
benefit
limitations
privacy
human oversight
judgement
scenario link
```

## 33. Common Command Term Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Answering state as explain | writing long paragraph for 1 mark | be direct |
| Answering explain as state | "Encryption is secure" | add how/why |
| No judgement for evaluate | only lists pros/cons | add conclusion |
| One-sided discuss answer | only advantages | include limitations |
| No comparison language | describes A only | mention both A and B |
| Definition uses only example | "RAM is memory in computer" | give exact meaning |
| Trace answer guesses output | no variable tracking | use trace table |
| Construct answer incomplete | SQL missing FROM | check required structure |
| Scenario ignored | generic answer | mention context |
| Marks ignored | one sentence for 6 marks | write enough points |

### Question 1

```text
Explain one advantage of using a database. [2]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It is better.
```

<details>
<summary>Improved Answer</summary>

A database can reduce data duplication because related data can be stored in separate linked tables instead of being repeated in many files.

</details>

---

### Question 2

```text
Explain why test data should be unseen. [2]
```

Weak answer:

```text
So it is fair.
```

<details>
<summary>Improved Answer</summary>

Test data should be unseen so the model is evaluated on examples it did not use during training. This gives a more reliable estimate of how well it will perform on new data.

</details>

---

### Question 3

```text
Describe packet switching. [3]
```

Weak answer:

```text
Packets go through internet.
```

<details>
<summary>Improved Answer</summary>

Packet switching splits data into smaller packets before transmission. Each packet can travel independently across the network and may take different routes. The packets are reassembled at the destination.

</details>

---

## 37. Practice Set C: Write Answers

Distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

Supervised learning uses labelled data, where each training example has a known correct output. It is used for tasks such as classification or regression. Unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data and tries to find patterns, groups, or anomalies without being given correct output labels.

</details>

---

### Question 5 [6 marks]

Discuss the use of BYOD in an organization.

<details>
<summary>Mark Scheme Style Answer</summary>

BYOD can reduce hardware costs because the organization does not need to buy every device for employees. It may also improve productivity because employees are familiar with their own devices. However, BYOD creates security risks because personal devices may be lost, infected with malware, or not updated. The organization may need mobile device management, encryption, access control, and clear policies. There may also be privacy concerns because employees may not want the organization to control personal devices.

</details>
