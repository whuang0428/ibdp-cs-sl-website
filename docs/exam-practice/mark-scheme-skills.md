# Mark Scheme Skills

## 1. Page Purpose

This page teaches students how to write answers that match the way mark schemes award marks.

Knowing the content is not enough. Students also need to know how to:

```text
turn knowledge into mark-worthy points
write separate points
add enough explanation
use correct technical terms
link answers to the scenario
avoid vague wording
self-mark answers
rewrite weak answers into stronger answers
```

A mark scheme usually rewards **specific, clear, relevant points**.  
It does not reward long but vague writing.

---

## 2. Learning Goals

By the end of this page, students should be able to:

- explain how mark schemes award marks
- identify mark-worthy points in an answer
- distinguish vague answers from mark-worthy answers
- use the Point → Expansion → Scenario Link structure
- write answers with correct technical vocabulary
- expand short answers appropriately
- avoid repeating the same point
- link answers to the given scenario
- self-mark answers using mark scheme thinking
- improve answers after marking
- write stronger answers for 2-mark, 4-mark, 6-mark, and extended questions
- apply mark scheme skills to hardware, networks, databases, ML, algorithms, and security questions

---

## 3. Core Idea

Most mark schemes reward answers that include:

```text
correct concept
clear technical detail
relevant explanation
scenario application
separate points
no contradiction
```

A good answer usually does this:

```text
Point → Expansion → Scenario Link
```

### Point

The main answer idea.

```text
Encryption improves confidentiality.
```

### Expansion

How or why it works.

```text
It converts data into unreadable ciphertext unless the user has the decryption key.
```

### Scenario Link

Why it matters in the given situation.

```text
This protects patient records if they are intercepted while being sent between hospital systems.
```

### Full Answer

```text
Encryption improves confidentiality because it converts data into unreadable ciphertext unless the user has the decryption key. This protects patient records if they are intercepted while being sent between hospital systems.
```

## 4. Bilingual Explanation

<LangBlock>
<template #cn>

### 中文说明

Mark scheme skills 的核心不是背答案，而是学会答案怎么拿分。

很多学生会写：

```text
It is secure.
It is faster.
It is better.
It is easy.
```

这些答案很常见，但是通常太 vague。  
Mark scheme 更喜欢：

```text
具体技术词
清楚解释
和题目 scenario 有关
每个点互相独立
```

比如题目问：

```text
Explain one benefit of using a VPN for remote hospital staff. [3]
```

弱答案：

```text
It is safe.
```

强答案：

```text
A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the remote worker's device and the hospital network. This reduces the risk of data being intercepted over the internet. This is important because remote staff may access sensitive patient records.
```

这个答案里有：

```text
technical point = encrypted tunnel
explanation = reduces interception risk
scenario link = remote staff / patient records
```

所以写答案时可以记住：

```text
不要只写“好”
要写“为什么好、怎么好、对这个 scenario 有什么用”
```

</template>

<template #en>

### English Explanation

Mark scheme skills are not about memorising full answers.  
They are about understanding how answers earn marks.

Many students write:

```text
It is secure.
It is faster.
It is better.
It is easy.
```

These answers are common, but usually too vague.  
Mark schemes prefer:

```text
specific technical terms
clear explanation
links to the scenario
separate independent points
```

Example question:

```text
Explain one benefit of using a VPN for remote hospital staff. [3]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It is safe.
```

Strong answer:

```text
A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the remote worker's device and the hospital network. This reduces the risk of data being intercepted over the internet. This is important because remote staff may access sensitive patient records.
```

This answer includes:

```text
technical point = encrypted tunnel
explanation = reduces interception risk
scenario link = remote staff / patient records
```

So when writing answers, remember:

```text
Do not only say it is good.
Say why it is good, how it works, and why it matters in this scenario.
```

## 5. What Makes a Point Mark-worthy?

A mark-worthy point is clear enough for an examiner to reward.

### Mark-worthy Points Usually Have

```text
correct CS term
clear meaning
specific detail
answer to the question
no contradiction
```

### Weak Point

```text
The database is better.
```

### Mark-worthy Point

```text
A relational database reduces data duplication because related data can be stored in separate linked tables.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
technical term = relational database
benefit = reduces duplication
mechanism = separate linked tables
```

---

## 6. One Mark, One Clear Point

For many questions, each mark is linked to one clear idea.

### Example Question

```text
State two advantages of fiber-optic cable. [2]
```

Strong answer:

```text
higher bandwidth
less affected by electromagnetic interference
```

Each point can earn one mark.

### Weak answer:

```text
It is very good and useful.
```

This may earn no marks because it is too vague.

### Rule

For short questions, make each mark visible.

---

## 7. Point + Expansion

For 2-mark and 4-mark questions, students often need expansion.

### Example Question

```text
Outline one advantage of cloud storage. [2]
```

Possible mark split:

```text
1 mark = advantage identified
1 mark = expansion
```

Strong answer:

```text
Cloud storage improves accessibility because users can access files from different devices and locations through the internet.
```

### Mark Breakdown

```text
accessibility = 1 mark
different devices/locations through internet = 1 mark
```

### Weak answer

```text
Cloud storage is convenient.
```

This may be too vague for full marks.

---

## 8. Separate Points

If a question asks for two reasons, the reasons must be different.

### Example Question

```text
Explain two advantages of using a database. [4]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It stores data safely. It keeps data secure.
```

These may overlap too much.

Strong answer:

```text
A database can reduce data duplication because related data can be stored once and linked using keys. It can also improve data integrity because validation rules and constraints can reduce invalid or inconsistent entries.
```

### Mark Breakdown

```text
Point 1 = reduce duplication
Expansion 1 = stored once and linked using keys
Point 2 = improve integrity
Expansion 2 = validation/constraints reduce invalid data
```

---

## 9. Scenario Links

Scenario-based questions often require students to apply knowledge.

### Generic Answer

```text
Backups are useful because data can be recovered.
```

### Scenario-linked Answer

```text
Backups allow the hospital to recover patient records after ransomware encrypts the live database, reducing disruption to appointments and treatment.
```

### Why It Is Stronger

It mentions:

```text
hospital
patient records
ransomware
live database
appointments and treatment
```

### Scenario Link Sentence Starters

```text
In this hospital...
For remote employees...
For patient records...
For the online shop...
For the student data...
For this machine learning system...
```

---

## 10. Technical Vocabulary

Mark schemes reward correct technical vocabulary.

### Examples

| Weak Wording | Better Technical Wording |
|---|---|
| data is safe | data is encrypted / access controlled |
| computer brain | CPU / processor |
| memory saves forever | secondary storage is non-volatile |
| database connects | foreign key references primary key |
| AI learns stuff | model is trained on data |
| internet box | router |
| computer checks it | algorithm evaluates a condition |
| repeats | iteration / loop |
| answer column | label / target |
| wrong prediction | false positive / false negative / error |

### Tip

Use the topic keyword from the question in your answer.

---

## 11. Avoid Vague Words

These words are often too general:

```text
good
bad
better
easy
fast
safe
secure
efficient
useful
nice
simple
smart
```

They can be used, but they need explanation.

### Weak

```text
It is faster.
```

### Strong

```text
A GPU can train a deep learning model faster because it performs many matrix calculations in parallel.
```

### Weak

```text
It is secure.
```

### Strong

```text
Multi-factor authentication improves security because an attacker needs a second verification method even if the password is stolen.
```

---

## 12. Match Answer Depth to Marks

### 1 Mark

```text
one correct term or fact
```

### 2 Marks

```text
one point + explanation
or two short points
```

### 3 Marks

```text
point + explanation + scenario link
or three linked points
```

### 4 Marks

```text
two developed points
```

### 6 Marks

```text
three developed points
or balanced explanation with context
```

### 8-12 Marks

```text
structured answer
multiple developed points
balance
scenario links
judgement/conclusion if required
```

---

## 13. Mark Scheme Answer Formula

Use this for many written answers:

```text
Point → Expansion → Scenario Link
```

### Example: Firewall

Point:

```text
A firewall filters network traffic.
```

Expansion:

```text
It applies security rules to allow or block packets.
```

Scenario link:

```text
This reduces unauthorized access to the company's internal network.
```

Full:

```text
A firewall filters network traffic by applying security rules to allow or block packets. This reduces unauthorized access to the company's internal network.
```

---

## 14. For Explain Questions

Explain questions need reason or effect.

### Useful Words

```text
because
so that
this means
therefore
as a result
which allows
which reduces
which prevents
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Explain why test data should be separate from training data. [3]
```

Strong answer:

```text
Test data should be separate so the model is evaluated on examples it has not seen during training. This gives a more reliable estimate of performance on new data. If the same data is used for training and testing, the model may appear accurate because it has memorized the training examples.
```

---

## 15. For Compare Questions

Compare questions require both sides.

### Weak

```text
LAN is small.
```

### Strong

```text
A LAN covers a small geographical area such as one school building, whereas a WAN covers a much larger area such as multiple cities or countries. Both allow devices to communicate and share resources.
```

### Compare Structure

```text
Similarity
Difference 1
Difference 2
```

### Useful Words

```text
whereas
while
both
unlike
in contrast
similar to
```

---

## 16. For Discuss Questions

Discuss questions need balance.

### Structure

```text
advantage
advantage
limitation
limitation
scenario link
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Discuss the use of BYOD in a hospital. [6]
```

Strong answer:

```text
BYOD can reduce hardware costs because the hospital does not need to provide every employee with a device. It may also improve user familiarity because staff already know how to use their own phones or laptops. However, BYOD creates security risks because personal devices may be lost, infected with malware, or not updated. The hospital would need controls such as mobile device management, encryption, and access control to protect patient records.
```

---

## 17. For Evaluate Questions

Evaluate questions need judgement.

### Structure

```text
benefit
benefit
limitation
limitation
condition / dependency
overall judgement
```

### Example Ending

```text
Overall, this solution is suitable if strong access control, encryption, and staff training are used, but it should not be used without regular monitoring because patient data is sensitive.
```

### Useful Words

```text
overall
to a large extent
however
this depends on
a limitation is
therefore
more suitable if
less suitable when
```

---

## 18. For Algorithm / Trace Questions

Mark schemes often reward method, not only final output.

### Algorithm Checklist

```text
input required values
initialize variables
use correct loop
use correct condition
update variables
output result
stop correctly
```

### Trace Checklist

```text
use inputs in order
record initial values
update counters
update accumulators
evaluate conditions
record every output
stop at the correct time
```

### Common Mark Scheme Points

```text
correct initialization
correct loop boundary
correct condition
correct update
correct output
```

---

## 19. For SQL Questions

SQL answers must be precise.

### Basic Query Pattern

```sql
SELECT field1, field2
FROM tableName
WHERE condition
ORDER BY field ASC;
```

### Mark Scheme Checklist

```text
correct SELECT fields
correct FROM table
correct WHERE condition
text values in quotes
LIKE for partial matches
DISTINCT if duplicates should be removed
ORDER BY if sorting is required
correct comparison operators
```

### Example

Question:

```text
List each patient name once where treatment includes therapy.
```

Answer:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT PatientName
FROM VISITS
WHERE Treatment LIKE '%therapy%';
```

---

## 20. For Database Design Questions

Database answers often reward correct relationships.

### Key Mark Scheme Words

```text
primary key
foreign key
unique identifier
referential integrity
one-to-many relationship
remove repeated data
reduce redundancy
avoid update anomaly
normalization
atomicity
transaction rollback
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Explain why a foreign key is used. [2]
```

Strong answer:

```text
A foreign key links a record in one table to a primary key in another table. This creates a relationship between tables and helps maintain referential integrity.
```

---

## 21. For Network Questions

Network answers should name devices, protocols, or controls accurately.

### Key Mark Scheme Words

```text
router
switch
packet
IP address
MAC address
TCP/IP
DNS
firewall
VPN
encryption
NAT
bandwidth
latency
packet switching
routing
authentication
access control
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Explain why DNS is used when accessing a website. [2]
```

Strong answer:

```text
DNS translates a domain name into an IP address so the browser can send the request to the correct web server.
```

---

## 22. For Machine Learning Questions

ML answers should identify data, features, labels, model, output, and evaluation.

### Key Mark Scheme Words

```text
training data
testing data
validation data
feature
label
model
prediction
classification
regression
supervised learning
unsupervised learning
accuracy
precision
recall
F1 score
overfitting
bias
privacy
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Explain why accuracy may be misleading in fraud detection. [3]
```

Strong answer:

```text
Fraud datasets are often imbalanced because most transactions are not fraud. A model may predict not fraud for almost every transaction and still get high accuracy. However, it may miss actual fraud cases, so recall or a confusion matrix may be more useful.
```

---

## 23. For Security Questions

Security answers should include:

```text
threat
control
how control works
scenario impact
limitation if relevant
```

### Example

Question:

```text
Explain how multi-factor authentication improves security. [3]
```

Strong answer:

```text
Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide more than one form of verification, such as a password and a one-time code. This means an attacker cannot access the account using only a stolen password. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
```

---

## 25. Weak to Strong Answer Examples

### Example 1: Encryption

Weak:

```text
Encryption is safe.
```

Strong:

```text
Encryption protects confidentiality by converting data into unreadable ciphertext, so intercepted data cannot be understood without the decryption key.
```

---

### Example 2: Database

Weak:

```text
A database stores data better.
```

Strong:

```text
A relational database can reduce redundancy by storing related data in separate tables and linking them using primary and foreign keys.
```

---

### Example 3: ML

Weak:

```text
Testing data checks the model.
```

Strong:

```text
Testing data evaluates the model on examples not used during training, giving a better estimate of how well the model generalizes to new data.
```

---

### Example 4: Network

Weak:

```text
A router sends internet.
```

Strong:

```text
A router forwards packets between different networks using IP addresses, allowing devices on a LAN to communicate with external networks such as the internet.
```

---

## 26. Self-marking Method

Use this method after each practice answer.

### Step 1: Count Points

Underline each separate point.

### Step 2: Check Expansion

Ask:

```text
Did I explain how or why?
```

### Step 3: Check Scenario Link

Ask:

```text
Did I mention the actual system/data/user from the question?
```

### Step 4: Check Technical Terms

Ask:

```text
Did I use the correct CS vocabulary?
```

### Step 5: Check Repetition

Ask:

```text
Are my points actually different?
```

### Step 6: Rewrite

Improve one weak sentence.

---

## 27. Marking Symbols for Teachers

A simple teacher marking system:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ | correct mark-worthy point |
| + | expansion needed |
| S | scenario link needed |
| T | technical term needed |
| R | repeated point |
| V | vague wording |
| X | incorrect concept |
| C | conclusion needed |
| ? | unclear meaning |

### Example Feedback

Student answer:

```text
It is secure and safe.
```

Teacher feedback:

```text
V + T + explain how
```

Improved answer:

```text
It improves security by encrypting data so that intercepted messages cannot be read without the decryption key.
```

---

## 28. Common Repeated Points

Students often repeat the same idea in different words.

### Example

```text
It protects data.
It keeps data safe.
It makes data secure.
```

These are not three separate points.

### Better Separate Points

```text
Encryption protects confidentiality.
Access control limits who can view data.
Backups allow data to be recovered after loss or ransomware.
```

### Exam Tip

Before writing the next point, ask:

```text
Is this actually a new idea?
```

---

## 29. Contradictions

Contradictions can lose marks.

### Example

```text
RAM is non-volatile and loses data when power is off.
```

This contradicts itself.

Correct:

```text
RAM is volatile because it loses data when power is switched off.
```

### Example

```text
A foreign key uniquely identifies each record in its own table.
```

This confuses foreign key with primary key.

Correct:

```text
A foreign key refers to the primary key in another table.
```

---

## 30. Long Answer Planning

For 6+ mark questions, plan before writing.

### Quick Plan

```text
P1 = technical benefit
P2 = second benefit
P3 = risk / limitation
P4 = safeguard
Conclusion if evaluate
```

### Example: Cloud Storage in Hospital

```text
benefit: accessibility for staff
benefit: backup/disaster recovery
risk: privacy/security of patient records
safeguard: encryption/access control
judgement: suitable only with strong controls
```

### Why Plan?

It avoids:

```text
repetition
one-sided answers
missing scenario links
weak conclusion
```

---

## 31. Answer Improvement Routine

After marking, rewrite the answer using this process:

```text
1. Replace vague words with technical terms.
2. Add one "because/how" explanation.
3. Add one scenario detail.
4. Remove repeated points.
5. Add a conclusion if the question asks evaluate.
```

### Example

Original:

```text
Cloud is good because it is easy.
```

Improved:

```text
Cloud storage improves accessibility because authorized staff can access records from different hospital locations through the internet. However, patient records must be protected using encryption and access control.
```

---

## 32. Worked Example: 2-mark Answer

Question:

```text
Outline one benefit of using an SSD instead of an HDD. [2]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It is faster.
```

Improved answer:

```text
An SSD has faster read/write speeds than an HDD because it has no moving parts, so applications and files can load more quickly.
```

### Mark Breakdown

```text
faster read/write speed = 1
no moving parts / load more quickly = 1
```

---

## 33. Worked Example: 4-mark Answer

Question:

```text
Explain two benefits of using a relational database. [4]
```

Strong answer:

```text
A relational database can reduce data redundancy because related data can be stored once in separate tables and linked using keys. It can also improve data integrity because constraints and validation rules can reduce invalid or inconsistent data.
```

### Mark Breakdown

```text
reduce redundancy = 1
stored once / linked tables = 1
improve data integrity = 1
constraints / validation reduce invalid data = 1
```

---

## 34. Worked Example: 6-mark Answer

Question:

```text
Discuss the use of BYOD in a hospital. [6]
```

Strong answer:

```text
BYOD can reduce hardware costs because the hospital does not need to buy a device for every employee. It may also improve productivity because staff are familiar with their own devices. However, personal devices may be less secure if they are not updated or if they are lost. This is risky because staff may access sensitive patient records. The hospital would need controls such as multi-factor authentication, mobile device management, encryption, and clear policies.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
benefit 1
benefit 2
risk
scenario link
controls
balanced discussion
```

---

## 35. Worked Example: 8-mark Evaluate Answer

Question:

```text
Evaluate whether a school should use a machine learning system to predict students at risk of failing. [8]
```

Strong answer:

```text
A machine learning system could help identify students who may need support earlier by analysing data such as attendance, previous grades, and assignment completion. This could allow teachers to provide targeted help before students fail.

However, the system may make incorrect predictions. A false positive could unfairly label a student as at risk, while a false negative could miss a student who needs support. The model may also be biased if the training data does not represent all students fairly.

Privacy is another concern because the system processes sensitive student data. The school should use data minimization, access control, fairness testing, and human oversight.

Overall, the system could be useful as a decision-support tool, but it should not automatically make decisions about students without teacher review and strong privacy safeguards.
```

### Why It Scores

```text
benefit
data examples
false positive/negative
bias
privacy
safeguards
judgement
scenario link
```

---

## 36. Practice Set A: Spot the Mark-worthy Points

### Question 1

```text
Explain why a VPN improves security for remote workers. [3]
```

Answer:

```text
A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the remote worker's device and the company network. This reduces the risk that data can be read if it is intercepted over the internet. It is useful for remote workers who need to access internal company systems from home.
```

Identify three mark-worthy points.

<details>
<summary>Suggested Answer</summary>

1. VPN creates an encrypted tunnel.  
2. It reduces risk of intercepted data being read.  
3. It supports remote workers accessing internal systems from home.

</details>

---

### Question 2

```text
Explain why accuracy may be misleading for fraud detection. [3]
```

Answer:

```text
Fraud datasets are often imbalanced because most transactions are not fraud. A model may predict not fraud for most transactions and still get high accuracy. However, it may miss actual fraud cases, so recall or a confusion matrix should also be considered.
```

Identify three mark-worthy points.

<details>
<summary>Suggested Answer</summary>

1. Fraud data is imbalanced.  
2. Predicting the majority class can still give high accuracy.  
3. The model may miss actual fraud cases, so recall/confusion matrix is useful.

</details>

---

## 37. Practice Set B: Improve the Answer

### Question 1

```text
Explain one advantage of using cloud storage. [2]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It is easy and good.
```

<details>
<summary>Improved Answer</summary>

Cloud storage improves accessibility because users can access files from different devices and locations through the internet.

</details>

---

### Question 2

```text
Describe the role of a router. [2]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It gives internet.
```

<details>
<summary>Improved Answer</summary>

A router forwards data packets between different networks. It uses IP addresses to decide where packets should be sent next.

</details>

---

### Question 3

```text
Explain why a primary key is used. [2]
```

Weak answer:

```text
It is important in database.
```

<details>
<summary>Improved Answer</summary>

A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, so a specific record can be found or referenced without confusion.

</details>

---

## 38. Practice Set C: Self-mark

### Question

```text
Explain two methods to protect data in a hospital database. [4]
```

Student answer:

```text
Use password and make data safe. Also backup is good.
```

### Task

Self-mark the answer and improve it.

<details>
<summary>Suggested Marking</summary>

Possible score: low, perhaps 1-2 marks depending on examiner generosity.  
`password` may get some credit if linked to access control, and `backup` is relevant, but explanation is too vague.

Improved answer:

```text
Access control can protect the database by allowing only authorized staff to view or edit patient records. Encryption can protect confidentiality by making stored or transmitted data unreadable without the decryption key. Backups can also allow patient records to be recovered if data is lost or encrypted by ransomware.
```

</details>

---

## 39. Mini Self-test

Before moving on, students should be able to answer these:

1. What is a mark-worthy point?
2. What does Point → Expansion → Scenario Link mean?
3. Why is "it is secure" too vague?
4. How can a 2-mark answer usually be structured?
5. How can a 4-mark answer usually be structured?
6. Why should scenario-based answers mention the given context?
7. What is one common repeated point mistake?
8. Why can contradictions lose marks?
9. What should an evaluate answer include?
10. How should students improve a weak answer?
